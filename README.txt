Lenape Language Learning Experience
===================================

This package contains a fully self-contained interactive learning experience designed for the Lenape community. It includes an offline-compatible version of a Genially-based activity, an interactive glossary, and associated audio files.

How to Use
----------

1. **Open the Experience Locally**  
   - Unzip the folder.  
   - Open `genially.html` in a web browser to start the learning experience.  
   - Click the floating "Glossary" button in the top-left corner (except on the title slide) to access vocabulary terms with audio.

2. **Host on a Web Server**  
   If you would like to make this accessible on a website like `https://lenape.org` or a subdomain:

   - Upload all the contents of this ZIP to a public HTML directory on your server.
   - The starting point is `genially.html`, so the full URL will look like:  
     `https://lenape.org/genially.html` or similar.

   - Make sure the file/folder structure is preserved:
     ```
     /audio/
     /glossary/
     genially.html
     ```

3. **GitHub Hosting (Optional)**  
   If you’d like to host this on GitHub Pages:

   - Create a new public GitHub repository.
   - Upload all files and folders.
   - Go to the repository’s **Settings > Pages** section.
   - Set the source to `main` branch and `/root`.
   - GitHub will give you a public URL like:  
     `https://yourusername.github.io/lenape-language/genially.html`
